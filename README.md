# pandas-challenge
Assignment 4

Commented in code. Did receive help from study group, tutoring session with Kourt, ChatGPT for debugging, stack overflow, and https://pandas.pydata.org/. 

Notes:
1. The data provided in the starter code did not show the percentages as formatted so I left them this way to match the desired output of the assignment. 
2. The code displays future warnings about observed=True but the code is still printing correct results. 
3. The assignment asks for a DF called per_school_summary. When I was working with my tutoring coach, he wanted me to name it per_school_summary_df for clarity so that's how I left it.  FYI.
